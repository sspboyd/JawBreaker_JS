# JawBreaker_JS
An updated JavaScript version of the JawBreaker code from 2014

JawBreaker is a generative drawing system. It works by selecting two points on an image, the first point is the origin and the second point is the edge. Circles are drawn between the origin and edge points. Each circle's colour is picked from the base image's colours along the line between the two points.

Built using P5.js.
